# PerfectionistPHP
> A Symfony project where good enough isn't good enough. - Anonymous Perfectionist

## What is this madness?

This is an experimental Symfony project that takes modern PHP tooling to its absolute limits. We're extreme perfectionists who believe that if you're going to write code, you might as well make it so clean it sparkles, so well-tested it's bulletproof, and so strictly typed that PHP starts questioning its own dynamism.

**Warning:** This project may cause excessive pride in your codebase, an inability to tolerate technical debt, and spontaneous refactoring sessions. Side effects include but are not limited to: perfectionist tendencies, tooling addiction, and an unhealthy obsession with green CI pipelines.

## Tech Stack

- **PHP 8.5** - Because we live on the bleeding edge
- **Symfony 7.4** - The framework that respects our perfectionist tendencies
- **Domain-Driven Design** - Because anemic models are for quitters

## Quality Standards (aka Our Obsessions)

### Code Style & Standards
- ✅ **PSR-12 Compliant** - No exceptions, no excuses
- ✅ **PHP-CS-Fixer** - Automatic formatting because manual formatting is for peasants
- ✅ **EditorConfig** - Consistent across all editors, because chaos is not an option

### Static Analysis (The Gatekeepers)
- ✅ **PHPStan Level max** - Maximum paranoia mode activated
- ✅ **Psalm** - Because two static analyzers are better than one
- ✅ **Rector** - Automated refactoring to keep us modern
- ✅ **PHP Insights** - Pretty metrics that make us feel good about ourselves

### Testing (Trust But Verify)
- ✅ **100% Code Coverage** - Not 99%, not 99.9%, exactly 100%
- ✅ **Mutation Testing (Infection)** - Because your tests testing your tests
- ✅ **Architecture Tests** - DDD boundaries shall not be crossed
- ✅ **Integration Tests** - Because units don't live in isolation
- ✅ **End-to-End Tests** - The full journey, every time

### Domain-Driven Design Enforcement
- ✅ **Bounded Context Isolation** - No leaky abstractions allowed
- ✅ **Value Objects Everywhere** - Primitive obsession is banned
- ✅ **Aggregate Root Validation** - Business rules in the domain, not controllers
- ✅ **Event Sourcing Ready** - Because we plan for the future
- ✅ **CQRS Implementation** - Commands and queries know their place

### CI/CD Pipeline (The Iron Curtain)
- ✅ **Pre-commit Hooks** - Stop bad code before it starts
- ✅ **Automated Quality Gates** - No human can be trusted with merge decisions
- ✅ **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning** - Trust no one, scan everything
- ✅ **Performance Monitoring** - Because perfect code should also be fast

### Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **All tests must pass** - Obviously
2. **100% code coverage** - Not 99.9%, not "close enough"
3. **PHPStan Level 9** - We don't negotiate with type errors
4. **PSR-12 compliance** - php-cs-fixer will hunt you down
5. **Mutation testing score > 95%** - Your tests better test your tests
6. **No primitive obsession** - Value objects or gtfo
7. **Bounded contexts respected** - Domain boundaries are sacred

### Pre-commit Checklist
- [ ] Did I write a test?
- [ ] Did I write tests for my tests?
- [ ] Does PHPStan still love me?
- [ ] Would my code make a perfectionist cry tears of joy?
- [ ] Am I absolutely certain this is the best code I've ever written?

## Philosophy

We believe that:

- Perfect code is attainable with the right tools and discipline
- If it's worth doing, it's worth overdoing
- Technical debt is a choice, and we choose differently
- Modern PHP is beautiful when wielded correctly
- Automation > Manual processes > Chaos
- Tests that don't test anything are worse than no tests
- Your IDE should be your copilot, not your crutch

## Acknowledgments

This project exists because we believe modern PHP deserves better than "it works on my machine." We stand on the shoulders of giants:

- The Symfony team for building a framework that doesn't fight our perfectionist tendencies
- The PHP community for creating the tooling that makes this obsession possible
- Every developer who ever said "this could be better" and actually made it better

## License

MIT - Because even perfectionists believe in freedom.

**Remember:** This is a learning project. We're taking things to extremes on purpose. Don't try this at home... or do, we're not your manager.
